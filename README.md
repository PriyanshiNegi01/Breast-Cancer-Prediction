# Breast Cancer Prediction

The Breast Cancer Prediction Data Analysis project aims to develop a predictive model for classifying breast cancer tumors as either 
benign or malignant. Breast cancer is a prevalent and life-threatening disease, and the early and accurate identification of tumor malignancy plays a vital role in treatment planning and patient outcomes. The project involves conducting in-depth analysis and exploration of an existing
dataset containing various attributes of breast tumors. The project's ultimate goal is to support medical professionals in making informed 
decisions, promoting early detection, and potentially saving lives through more accurate and timely interventions.

## Tools Used

  1. Python programming language
  2. Numpy and Pandas for exploratory analysis
  3. Matplotlib for data visualization
  4. Jupyter notebook as IDE
